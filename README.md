# gta2_sty_browser

GTA2 STY Browser is a small program that can read and display the contents of the .sty files used for graphics in Grand Theft Auto 2. The program is mainly made to help with reverse engineering and cloning GTA2.

At the moment it supports showing Cars, Pedestrians, Map Objects, Code Objects, User Objects and Fonts. It also supports changing the remap used, which works well for pedestrians and cars, but not so well for other categories.
